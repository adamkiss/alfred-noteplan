# Noteplan FTS for Alfred (DEAD BRANCH)

This was an attempt to make the v2.0.0 of this workflow compiled with `vercel/pkg` as a single executable for both `x64` (old macs) and `arm64` (new mX macs) architectures.

Rough, working version is done, I just can't make the packaging work for both architectures. Even configuring the main asset - the [WiseLibs/better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3) library - for the `arm64` version is giving me headaches, and after spending a couple of hours trying to understand how it actually works, I'm throwing in the towel.
