![OG Social image](social.png)

## What is this

Noteplan for Alfred brings all your Noteplan notes to Alfred! Use it to:

- üîç Search through all of your notes, with **full-text search**
- ‚ö° **Use Noteplan as link manager** - Search through all of your hyperlinks, and immediately open them in your default browser
- üåà **Use Noteplan as snippet manager** - Search through your code bits (with title and description), and automatically paste them to your frontmost app
- ‚ú® Create new notes easily
- üìÜ Go to an exact date, fuzzy date or even a weekly/monthly/quarterly note

## Usage
- `n [Search phrase]` - Full text search. If there isn't any note available, "Create new note" command is the only result
- `nh [Phrase]` - Search through all the hyperlinks you noted down - and open them immediately
- `nc [Phrase]` - Search for all your titled code bits - and paste them to the frontmost app
- `nd [date phrase]` - Very simple exact/relative date parser
- `nn [Title of the note]` - Creates a new note, in the folder of your choice
- `n !r` - Refresh note database
- `n !rf` - Force refresh every note in the database
- `n !!` - Show debug information

All commands are configurable. To keep the workflow from being too complicated, if you don't wish to use a feature, just set the trigger to something complicated like `XYZ-extremely-unlikely-to-use`

### Hyperlinks

Every hyperlink - `[The title and a description](https://example.com)` - is searchable, through the title and description and the link itself as well. **The default action for a hyperlink is to open it in a default browser**, to open the containing note, hit <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>‚Ü©</kbd>.

### Code bits

Every block of code **with a title/description** is matched as a snippet. **Default action is "copy and paste in the frontmost app"**, to open the containing note, hit <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>‚Ü©</kbd>.

#### Example code bit:

```
    ```language (Title and a description in parentheses)
        This code bit will be matched as codebit by content, language and the title and description.
    ```
```

### Date parser
- `t ‚Ä¶ today` - today's note
- `y ‚Ä¶ yesterday` - yesterday's note
- `tom ‚Ä¶ tomorrow` - tomorrow's note
- `[20]?220401` - exact date in Ymd format, where the initial 20 is optional
- `0401` - exact day, current year (month first)
- `4/1` - exact day, current year (month first, leading zero optional)
- `1.4` - exact day, current year (day first, leading zero optional)
- `1 4` - exact day, current year (leading zero optional, d/m order configurable)
- `[-+]? [number] [dw]` - relative date, number of days or weeks back and forward. spaces are optional
- `[wmq]` - this week's (month's, quarter's) note
- `[wmq] [number]` -  weekly (monthly, quarterly) note of w/m/q X
- `[wmq] -|+ [number]` - relative week's (month's, quarter's) note (spaces optional)
- `yr|year` - this year's note
- `yr|year [XY]` - note of the year 20XY
- `yr|year -|+ [number]` - relative year (spaces optional)

## Installation
1. Download the workflow (`alfred-noteplan-X.Y.Z.alfredworkflow`) from the ['Releases' page](https://github.com/adamkiss/alfred-noteplan/releases) and import the workflow to Alfred
2. Configure the workflow as you need and want
    - the most important and required part is the **Noteplan root folder**
    - get it through `Noteplan Options` > `Sync` > `'Advanced' for your active Sync option` > `Open local database`
    - this will open a Finder window
    - in this window, with **nothing selected**, press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to copy the pathname 
    - paste that into the workflow import window
3. Trust the app. This step is necessary because [the app is not signed](#why-all-the-warnings).      
   1. Type `n ` in Alfred - macOS will warn you that this app is unsigned and you can move it to bin or cancel.
   2. Open **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click "Allow Anyway". (In macOS before 13/Ventura, _System Settings_ is called _System Preferences_.)
   3. Type `n ` in Alfred again - macOS will warn you _again_ that this app was downloaded from the internet and might not be safe.
   4. The dialog now has an **Open** option. Click **Open** to finalize the authorization.
4. Profit!
5. You can now do a search, date query or add a new note

### Why all the warnings?
To have macOS accept your app as safe, the developer needs to cryptographically sign it. That requires a $99/year Apple Developer Program, which I don't need for anything else, so the two warnings are acceptable for a free workflow, in my opinion.

### Wasn't there a refresh command?
There was. But with the new version, the workflow refreshes only changed notes since last update, and that's often a tiny number, so the databse is updated every time this workflow is run (with a timeout ~10 seconds, so when you're constructing your query, it runs only on the first letter).
